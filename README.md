Research Narrative:

I. 

The topic I chose for my research is whether or not living by a park influences the sense of community one feels and experiences. For the places I chose to research I chose Gas Works Park in Seattle Washington, Kentwood High School in Covington Washington, and Bridle Trails State Park in Kirkland Washington. The search word I chose to use was “community” because I felt that the word community provided the best search term base my research. For Gas Works Park and Bridle Trails State Park I searched for tweets within four miles of each location. I chose 4 miles because I got a good number of tweets to base my research on and because most people travel and stay within 5 miles of their place of living, which ends up being their community circle. For Kentwood High School I searched for tweets within eight miles of the school because 4 miles did not give me a good number of tweets to base my research on. I also looked up the zoning for that school, and people who attend usually live within an eight-mile radius of the school, which gives me the general area of the community of people who go to the school and live in that area. 

II. 

I wanted to make this comparison because in previously built environment courses I have taken, we discussed how parks are a great asset to people's communities and help to draw people together and make them feel more connected to their communities. I chose Gas Works Park and Bridle Trails State Park because they are both in high population density areas, and I felt like these locations would give me a good sample of tweets to base my research on with peoples varying opinions on the community in those areas. To strengthen my argument, I chose Kentwood High School as a countering sample because Kentwood High school does not really have any parks around the area and I wanted to use the tweet data from that area to compare and contrast with the tweet data of the two parks I chose.

III. 

Similarities: I am going to focus on the 3 main similarities I found. Gas Works most prominent tweet word is Seattle and Kentwoods most prominent tweet word is Community. I decided to keep the word community because I saw it as a necessary word to keep as it's a key part of my research. This shows that people who live/have visited both areas feel a connection to the community. Another similarity I found is that they both have a great abundance of words in their word cloud. Even tho I gave a bigger mileage search parameter for Kentwood, I still think this shows the significance that despite not being near parks that, people who live near Kentwood still feel a similar amount of connection as people who live near gasworks do. The last main similarity I found is that the word “New” and “Work” were both fairly prevalent in the Kentwood and Bridle Falls word clouds. I believe this shows that both places are currently in a state of development and gentrification as industry and people move out to those places. This shows that a new community is forming as people move and the area changes. 

Differences: Some differences I found are that Bridle Falls word cloud is significantly more sparse then Gas works and Kentwoods word clouds. This shows that people who live around Bridle Falls dont feel as connected to their community. Also, the words in Bridle Falls word cloud are more geared towards work and industry. For example, the most prominent words are: Microsoft, New, Join, Work, Build, and Team. This shows that the sense of community for this place has more to do with where people work and their careers than the connections they form with others when that's the case for Gas Works and Kentwood.

IV. 

The possible reasons for the patterns I observed all have to do with how established a community is and the industry/work offered within that community. The community and neighborhoods surrounding gasworks have been around forever, so it makes sense that Gas Works would have a more community-oriented word cloud. The same goes for Kentwood. Even though it had the words “New” and “Work”, it's still a major residential suburban area with families that's been established for decades, so it also has had time to build up the community in that area which is why it had such a dense word cloud. The area around Bridle Falls is a completely different story. While the area has also been populated for decades, Microsoft is starting to take over the neighborhood, which is changing the types of people who used to live there before the takeover. It's now a very up-and-coming tech area that is very career oriented and focused, which makes sense why their community word cloud was the most sparse.

V.

I could improve my research in the future by using more search words that discuss community. Search words such as friends, family, volunteer, or support. While the word community does help narrow my tweet search by only including tweets that specifically mention community, using more search words could help me find tweets that discuss people's communities without explicitly using the word community. This would give me even more tweets to work with and draw conclusions on.

VI. 

I was very surprised to see that Kentwood had a bigger community word cloud than the area around Bridle Falls. It went against my previous thought that Bridle Falls area would have a bigger word cloud because parks help support and bring communities together. However, after thinking about what types of people different areas appeal to and why (explained above) it made sense that the high tech Bridle Falls area would have a lessened sense of community compared to Kentwood.
